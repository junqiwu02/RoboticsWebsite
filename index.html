                generating mayhem ever since 2014, and we have created multiple new FRC teams in our area, along
                with other teams in FIRST. By allowing our students to gain sports credit for joining the team, we
                produce hardworking, dedicated students who strive to become engineers and technicians.

                    FIRST is a worldwide organization, inspiring kids to pursue their dreams and
                    learn through hands on challenges in robotics and science. Our team Electric Mayhem 4930 is
                    proud
                    to have been participating in FIRST Robotics Competition since 2013. Along with FRC, our school
                    participates in FIRST Lego League and FIRST Tech Challenge.

                <h4>Electric Mayhem - FRC Team 4930</h4>
                <p>
                    Our original FRC team, which started in 2014, has grown tremendously and led to the
                    creation of many more teams in all areas of FIRST. The team, which was initially started by
                    a small group of ambitious students, has grown to reach and influence multiple deteremined
                    students across Nichols High School, and continues to expand each year. Our school offers
                    sports credit for the team members, allowing them to focus and put in their best effort on
                    all our fantastic robots.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Electric Mayhem - FTC Team 12736 and 12737</h4>
                <p>
                    The newest edition to the Nichols School, Electric Mayhem family, our FTC team. This team is
                    made up of the students of the engineering class, a senior/junior elective, in our school.
                    By having a class become a robotics team, it not only teaches students engineering skills,
                    it gives them a real experience of engineering work environment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Electric Mayhem - FLL Team</h4>
                <p>
                    The FLL Team is made up of students in Nichols Middle School. Like the Upper School, this
                    team is made up of hardworking students, who are eager to learn and use robots. Despite
                    being younger, our students put just as much effort into their work as any of our other
                    teams. The students from this team generally go on to join our FRC Team or our FTC Team, or
                    even both!

                    We participate because our school has an overwhelming number of students who love building,
                    working with, and competing with robots. FIRST allows our students to gain real world
                    knowledge, outside of the classroom. Students overcome challenges and problems they never
                    thought they would be dealing with in High School, and prepares them for future jobs.

                    FIRST Power Up --- 2017's FIRST competition has our team battling in an arcade arena. This year
                    we have to build a robot to place cubes on to the field's switches and scale in order to earn
                    points for alliance. Along with this, we can use the cubes to gain power ups for team to boost
                    our scores. Finnally, by the end of the match, our robot has to grab on to a 1 foot rod and
                    climb up a tower, and help other robots accomplish this task as well.
